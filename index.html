        <p class = "view">I'm Edward Schembor, a junior Computer Science major at Johns Hopkins University. My interests currently lie in distributed systems, data analysis/science, graph databases, and computer engineering in general.</p>
        <p class = "view">This is mainly a place for me to organize my thoughts, projects, etc. Below is a list of things that I've created. For a more complete list, check my Github profile.</p>
		<p class = "view">Garcon: A startup based on an app which allows users to create tasks for other users near them to complete. E-mail me for more information.</p>
        <p class = "view"><a href="https://github.com/edschembor/PrimalPy"> PrimalPy:</a> Python package for prime numbers. Currently a collection of primality tests - prime generation algorithms in the works. It originated as a way for me to practice translating math into efficient code.</p>
		<p class = "view"><a href="https://github.com/edschembor/HA_Chat"> HAChat:</a> A highly available distributed chat application - clients can continue to chat even when servers become partitioned as the system is eventually consistent. Uses lamport timestamps for merge conflicts. </p> 
        <p class = "view"><a href="https://github.com/edschembor/RingProtocol"> Ring Protocol:</a> A C implementation of the token ring protocol for distributed system file transfers.</p>
        <p class = "view"> Notester: Note-sharing site for AP classes and the SATs. My first trial in web design. Site has been taken down due to lack of funding but am working on getting it back up soon.</p>
