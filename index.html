        <p class = "view">I'm Edward Schembor, a senior Computer Science major at Johns Hopkins University. My interests currently lie in distributed systems, machine learning, and computer engineering in general. I will be working at Microsoft working on Azure beginning summer 2016.</p>
        <p class = "view">This is mainly a place for me to organize my thoughts, projects, etc. Below is a list of things that I've created. For a more complete list, check my Github profile.</p>
		<p class = "view"><a href="./ml_paper.pdf">SVM For Loan Default Predictions:</a> A machine learning paper based on using a dual-from Support Vector Machine in order to predict Loan Defaults on LendingClub loan data. </p>
        <p class = "view"><a href="https://github.com/edschembor/PrimalPy"> PrimalPy:</a> Python package for prime numbers. Currently a collection of primality tests - prime generation algorithms in the works. It originated as a way for me to practice translating math into efficient code.</p>
		<p class = "view"><a href="https://github.com/edschembor/HA_Chat"> HAChat:</a> A highly available distributed chat application - clients can continue to chat even when servers become partitioned as the system is eventually consistent. Uses lamport timestamps for merge conflicts. </p> 
        <p class = "view"><a href="https://github.com/edschembor/RingProtocol"> Ring Protocol:</a> A C implementation of the token ring protocol for distributed system file transfers.</p>
        <p class = "view"> Notester: Note-sharing site for AP classes and the SATs. My first trial in web design. Site has been taken down due to lack of funding but am working on getting it back up soon.</p>
