<h1> PennApps Spring 2015 </h1>

<p> Last week, I had the privelage of attending my first PennApps event. From start to finish, PennApps is essentially a normal hackathon on steroids. </p>

<p> When I got accepted to PennApps, I didn't know anyone else who was going. Thanks to the hackathon's FB page, I was able to form a team with a Sophomore from MIT and a genius high school student from Germany. After some initial discussion online, we were pretty set on doing a hack related to searching for cheap travel options.</p>

<p> After checking-in and meeting up with my teammates, we headed towards the main autidorium for the opening ceremonies. There, the PennApps and Major League Hacking joint staff did an awesome job of pumping everyone up for the upcoming 36 hours of coding. </p>

<p> My group found a nice spot in a relatively hidden area with a bunch of whiteboards. We were joined by a few other groups and the secluded nature of our spot led to some nice inter-group chatting and collaboration. </p>

<p> After some further discussion, my group's project was decided on: a search engine which would allow users to find the cheapest possible route between any two locations in North America and Western Europe. Our first task was to scrape the data for airplane/train/bus schedules. For North American buses, I was able to figure out the url pattern of busbud.com, scrape the necessary data from the page's source with the urllib2 python library, and return it all as a nicely formatted JSON file. Another member of my group then used a similar method to scrape data for European train/buses, but with REST calls. We then used Kayak's API to get intercontinental flight data.</p>

<p> Once we had all of the data scraped based on the user's query, we were able to generate a graph of the possible travel options, where nodes represented cities and edges represented distinct travel options (ie. bus at 10AM, train at noon). Therefore, nodes were allowed to have many-to-many relationships. Once we generated a graph from the data, we could simply run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path, using price as the edge weights. </p>

<p> After 36 straight hours of hacking (with a total of 5 hours of sleep and 5 Red Bulls), it was time to present our finished project. The presentations were done science fair style, where each group is assigned a table and judges walk around and look at the projects. Unfortunately during one of our presentations for a judge, we had an issue where our scraping didn't gather sufficient data. Luckily we were able to show it off to some Facebook reps who were pretty interested. The ChallengePost page for the project can be found <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/fliptrip">here</a>.</p>

<p> Even with 36 hours, there were some things which I wish we had had time to implement. One was a slider which would allow a user to choose if they wanted the results to be purely value-based (lowest travel cost), conveniency based (lowest travel time), or some combination of the two. Doing this would have just required changing the weights on the graph edges and the running the exact same shortest-path algorithm.</p>

<p> All in all, PennApps was a great experience! I got to meet so many exceptional and creative engineers, hear programmers from some companies I'd love to work at speak, and see some awesome hacks. I've now got some great motivation/experience to put towards PennApps Fall 2015.</p>
