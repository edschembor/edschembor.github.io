<h1> Using OpenCV to Tell If My Laundry Is Done </h1>
<p> I hate not knowing when my laudnry is done. The dryer in my house has a setting where it continues until your clothes are a certain
amount dry, as opposed to a hard time limit. Because of this, I never know when my laundry is done and end up
unnecessarily checking the machine multiple time. So, I decided to dabble in computer vision and see if I could
set up a webcam to watch the machine's dial and see if it had finished.</p>

<p> <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> is the opensource computer vision library which I decided to use for this project because of its Python interface and great tutorial/documentation community. Go check out the project if this is your first time hearing of it, it's really cool.</p>

<p> My first step was to get an image of the machine's dial in the completed position (see below). Once I had that, I could
compare it to the image from the webcam. Since the dial ticks were small, I added a piece of brown tape so that I could then check the color of the image in a specific area for the tape to see if the drying had finished.  </p>
