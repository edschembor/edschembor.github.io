<h1> Using OpenCV to Tell If My Laundry Is Done </h1>
<p> The dryer in my house has a setting where it continues until your clothes are a certain
amount dry, as opposed to a hard time limit. Because of this, I never know when my laundry is done and end up
unnecessarily checking the machine multiple time. So, I decided to dabble in computer vision and see if I could
set up a webcam to watch the machine's dial and see if it had finished.</p>

<p> <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> is an opensource computer vision library, with C++, C, Python, and Java interfaces. It also has a pretty good tutorial/documentation community.</p>

<p> FUTURE VISUAL OF THE MACHINE WITH CAPTION </p>

<p> My first step was to get an image of the machine's dial in the completed position (see above). Now, I could
compare this image to the image from the webcam and use template matching to see if it was the case that the
images matched to some degree </p>

<p> OpenCV has a few different comparison methods built-in. I decided to use XXX because XXX </p>

<p> Notes: <p>
<ul>
	<li><p>I'm using OpenCV version 2.4.9.</p></li>
	<li><p>Not sure how sensitive this is to lighthing - want to do some more experimenting</p></li>
</ul>
