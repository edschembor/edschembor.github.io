<h1> Garcon </h1>

<p> Just a quick post to say that the website for my startup <a href=http://edschembor.github.io/Garcon_Website/garcon.html> Garcon </a> is now up. The basic goal of Garcon is to allow people to create tasks and others to perform tasks. If you have some time, check it out. I'll be posting (hopefully) frequently on the Dev Blog on the Garcon site if you're interested in following the startups progress/hearing why we make certain technical choices.</p>
