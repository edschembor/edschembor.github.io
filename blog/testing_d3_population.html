<h1> Visualizing NYC Population Changes / Testing D3 </h1>
<p> Recently, I've been looking for a good tool to visualize graphs from neo4j. After searching for a bit and testing some tools, I eventually settled on Gephi. However, I discovered the wonderful world of Data-Driven Documents (<a href="www.d3js.org">D3 Link</a>).</p>
<p> Now, I've been fooling around with the library and trying to create some interesting visualizations. The D3 website has some great examples. One which caught my eye was a <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4341417">dynmaic donut chart</a>. So, I decided do do something similar: a donut chart which shows demographic changes in NYC over time. With the code from the example, it was relativly straightforward to get it working with 2 years of data (gathered from Wikipedia). The trick was to get it to work with more than 2 years of data (solved by changing the transition code) and adding a quick year counter. I haven't done much work in Javascript, so it was a nice intro to some of the workings of the language.</p>
<p> The finished chart: </p>
